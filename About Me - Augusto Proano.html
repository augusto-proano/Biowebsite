		<p>I am Augusto Proano, I am 24 years old, currently living in the city of New York.
		I was born in Queens but I grew up in Quito-Ecuador, I guess I am from both places and I love that, I have learn so much from both cultures and life styles.
		<br><br>
		Quito is beautiful city located in the middle of the World; gravity and other factors are affected over there; a lot of cool natural phenomena occur down there. It is a city surrender by volcanos, luckily most of them inactive, and it has been built in the middle of mountains.

		New York in the other side one of the most populated cities in World; what I love about this city is that the World lives in here, every culture every background you can image, you can find it over here, that way you can learn from their cultures and take good habits from them. I love the lights in the city and how they leave you speechless, It is a huge city with a lot of cool buildings, nice places to visit, and a mixture of all cultures.

		Always Passionate about helping others especially young people. I have worked in some foundations as a social worker, also I have extensive experience in customer service. I love how technology help me fulfill all my passions at once. helping connect and help each other through the information we share, that is the reason why I got into web development and design to make the information people need and want to share accessible in a way they have not seen it before. I am also involved in 3D modeling and design, sketching, motion Graphics, photography music, among others.
